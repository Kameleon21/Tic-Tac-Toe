# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Description 

The aim of this project was learning how to use module patterns and factory functions, as well as starting to understand how closure works and the difference between lexical scope and block scope. 

The biggest challenge I found with this project was trying to figure out how to begin and where to start. I found working with factory function, pretty interesting and fun and I can see why they are another tool that people lean on when trying to construct an object.
